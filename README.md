# Networks-Project
Code for Web Server Project, UChicago MPCS 54001 - Networks

I worked with a partner to complete this project. The assignment required the server to:
- Support GET and HEAD requests.
- Accept one command-line flag (--serverPort), indicating which TCP port to bind to.
- Support encrypted connections via HTTPS, using TLS (SSL 3.0)
- Support persistent connections

The project had 2 parts. If the links are still active, the full assignment can be found here:
